# Java Swing Template

This template lets you code Java Swing projects in Codespaces and have a "window" to show the resulting GUI in.

## To View GUI

To view the Java Swing GUI output, do the following:
- under "PORTS" add in port 6080, if it is not already there
- click on the ðŸŒŽ ("Open in Browser") that will show up in the port line, under the "Forwarded Address" section
- click on "ðŸ”— Connect" in the noVNC window that pops up
- enter password "vscode"

## Run Java Swing Code

- now run your Java Swing code as normal and watch your Java Swing GUI show up in the window!
