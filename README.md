# Java Swing Template

![Java Swing image](./images/java_swing.jpg)

This template lets you code Java Swing projects in Codespaces and have a "window" to show the resulting GUI in. To create your own GitHub repository and Codespace from this template, click on the green "Use this template" button above and to the right. Then select "Create repository from template" and fill in the name you would like your new Gitub repository to have.

**NOTE**: This Codespace will take over 4 minutes to "build" the very first time, please be patient!

## To View GUI

To view the Java Swing GUI output, do the following:
- under "PORTS" add in port 6080, if it is not already there
- click on the ðŸŒŽ ("Open in Browser") that will show up in the port line, under the "Forwarded Address" section
- click on "ðŸ”— Connect" in the noVNC window that pops up
- enter password "vscode"

## Run Java Swing Code

Now run your Java Swing code as normal and watch your Java Swing GUI show up in the window!

## Shutting Down Codespace

When you are done coding, remember to "shutdown" the codespace so you do not "waste" the limited number of compute cycles that GitHub gives you each month.

- goto "File, My Codespaces"
- find your "Active" codespace
- select "..." (Show more actions for Codespace)
- select "Stop Codespace"
