# Java Swing Template

This template lets you code Java Swing projects in Codespaces and have a "window" to show the resulting GUI in.

**NOTE**: This Codespace will take over 4 minutes to "build" the very first time, please be patient!

## To View GUI

To view the Java Swing GUI output, do the following:
- under "PORTS" add in port 6080, if it is not already there
- click on the ðŸŒŽ ("Open in Browser") that will show up in the port line, under the "Forwarded Address" section
- click on "ðŸ”— Connect" in the noVNC window that pops up
- enter password "vscode"

## Run Java Swing Code

Now run your Java Swing code as normal and watch your Java Swing GUI show up in the window!

## Shutting Down Codespace

When you are done coding, remember to "shutdown" the codespace so you do not "waste" the limited number of compute cycles that GitHub gives you each month.

- goto "File, My Codespaces"
- find your "Active" codespace
- select "..." (Show more actions for Codespace)
- select "Stop Codespace"
